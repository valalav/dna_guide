- When working with CRAM files, the specific reference genome used for their creation is required for decompression and processing. This is a key feature of the CRAM format.
- I am waiting for the CPU script `extract_atdna_final.sh` to finish. The system is extremely overloaded, and I can't monitor the process actively. I should wait for about 15-20 minutes before checking the status again.
