ACT AS: Expert Population Geneticist and Bibliographer.

OBJECTIVE:
Conduct a comprehensive systematic review of peer-reviewed scientific literature published between **January 2020 and January 2026**.
Focus on **Ancient DNA (aDNA)**, **Y-Chromosome Phylogeny**, and **Human Population Genetics** of the following regions:
1.  **Caucasus** (North and South)
2.  **Pontic-Caspian Steppe**
3.  **Near East / Anatolia** (as related to Caucasus)
4.  **Eastern Europe** (Migration Period/Medieval connections)

CRITERIA FOR SELECTION:
*   **Impact:** Prioritize papers in high-impact journals (Nature, Science, Cell, AJHG, PNAS, Nature Communications, Current Biology, MBE).
*   **Relevance:** Must contain Y-DNA haplogroup data or significant autosomal admixture modeling (qpAdm/PCA) relevant to the regions above.
*   **Timeframe:** Strictly 2020-2025 (inclusive).

TASK:
1.  **Identify** every major study fitting the criteria.
2.  **Systematize** them by topic/region.
3.  **Analyze** the key findings concisely (bullet points, no fluff).
4.  **Provide access** via direct DOI links and, where possible, links to supplementary data or PDFs.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate a **Markdown Table** with the following columns:
| Date | Title | Authors | Journal | Key Findings (Concise) | Key Samples/Haplogroups | Link (DOI/PDF) |

REQUIRED SECTIONS:

### 1. Ancient DNA: The Caucasus (Maikop, Kura-Araxes, Koban, Alans)
*   Look for Lazaridis et al. (2022, 2024), Wang et al. updates, and Russian/local journals if indexed.

### 2. Ancient DNA: The Steppe & Migration Period (Scythians, Sarmatians, Huns, Avars, Khazars)
*   Look for papers on the Avar Khaganate (2022-2024), Saltovo-Mayaki, and Iron Age Steppe.

### 3. Methodological Breakthroughs (Y-DNA Phylogeny & TMRCA)
*   Papers refining the mutation rates or TMRCA of major haplogroups (G2a, R1a, J2a, R1b).

### 4. Modern Population Studies
*   High-resolution sequencing of modern Caucasian populations (Circassians, Georgians, Ossetians, etc.).

INSTRUCTIONS:
*   **No "Water":** Do not write generic summaries like "This paper discusses genetics." Be specific: "Identified G-L1264 in 7th c. Hungary."
*   **Full Links:** Ensure every entry has a clickable DOI url (https://doi.org/...).
*   **Completeness:** Do not miss the "big" papers from the Reich Lab, Max Planck (Johannes Krause), or Copenhagen (Eske Willerslev).
