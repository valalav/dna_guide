## 🏗️ Scenario 1: The "4.2ky Event" & L1264 Founder Effect

**Theory:**
The TMRCA of **G-L1264** is ~4400 ybp (~2400 BCE). This coincides perfectly with the **4.2 kiloyear event** (super-drought ~2200 BCE) and the end of the Maikop culture.
**Hypothesis:** L1264 represents a small lineage that survived the climate collapse (Founder Effect), while other Maikop lineages (like J2a-M67) were bottlenecked or displaced.

**Prompt for Deep Research:**

PERFORM A CROSS-DISCIPLINARY ANALYSIS:
1.  **Paleoclimatology:** Find specific studies on the "4.2 kiloyear event" impact in the **Northwest Caucasus** (Kuban river basin, Sochi/Adler region) between 2500-2000 BCE.
2.  **Archaeology:** Look for evidence of "settlement abandonment" or "population replacement" in Late Maykop / Early Dolmen cultures during this exact window.
3.  **Genetics:** Search for any ancient DNA models proposing a "population bottleneck" in the Caucasus around 4000-4500 BP (years before present).
4.  **Target:** Validate if the G-L1264 TMRCA (4400 ybp) aligns with a documented demographic collapse in the region.

KEYWORDS: "4.2 ka event Caucasus", "Maykop culture collapse", "Dolmen culture origins", "Holocene climate Caucasus pollen data"
DATA SOURCES: Nature Scientific Reports, Quaternary Science Reviews (2020-2025).

## 🦅 Scenario 2: The Avar Auxiliary (AU78077)

**Context:**
Sample **AU78077** (Gerber et al. 2024) is the **first ancient G-L1264** found in an Avar Khaganate context (Hungary, 7th c. CE).
**Problem:** Was he an Avar? Or an Alan/Caucasian auxiliary/hostage?

**Prompt for Deep Research:**
```text
INVESTIGATE SAMPLE AU78077 (Gerber et al. 2024):
1.  **Isotope Analysis:** Did the paper (or supplementary tables) provide Strontium (Sr) or Oxygen (O) isotope data for AU78077? Was he a local of the Pannonian Basin or a long-distance migrant?
2.  **Grave Goods:** Describe the exact burial context of AU78077.
    *   Weaponry: Nomad sabre vs Alanic straight sword?
    *   Belt fittings: "Griffin" style (Avar) or other?
3.  **Genetic Neighbors:** In the PCA/IBD analysis, does AU78077 cluster with "Core Avars" (East Asian profile) or "Presumed Alans" (Caucasus/Sarmatian profile)?
4.  **Check for Relatives:** Are there any 3rd-5th degree cousins of AU78077 in the full Avar dataset?

OUTPUT: Detailed forensic profile of Individual AU78077.

## 🏛️ Scenario 3: The Hattic-Maykop Connection (J2a-M67)

**Context:**
J2a-M67 is found in **Maykop** (Caucasus) and **Arslantepe** (Anatolia) in the same era (~3500 BCE). Linguists link NWC (Adyghe-Abkhaz) languages to ancient **Hattic** (Central Anatolia).

**Prompt for Deep Research:**
```text
COMPARE ANCIENT DNA OF MAYKOP AND PRE-HITTITE ANATOLIA:
1.  **Select Samples:**
    *   Maykop/Novosvobodnaya: I6268, I6266 (J2a-M67/CTS900).
    *   Arslantepe (Late Chalcolithic): Arslantepe 19, Arslantepe 22.
    *   Alaca Höyük (Early Bronze Age): "Royal Tombs" samples (if sequenced).
2.  **Genetic Distance:** Find f3-statistics or qpAdm models in recent papers (Lazaridis 2022, 2024) specifically comparing "Maykop" vs "Anatolia_ChL" (Chalcolithic).
3.  **Migration Vector:** Do models suggest Anatolia -> Caucasus (colonization) or Caucasus -> Anatolia (influence)?
4.  **Linguistic Correlation:** Search for 2023-2025 papers discussing the "Hattic-Kaskian-Northwest Caucasian" linguistic macrofamily in light of new genetic data.

GOAL: Establish if J2a-M67 was the "Hattic marker".
```

## 🏔️ Scenario 4: The Komi-Khazar Anomaly (G-Y513104)

**Context:**
G-L1264 > **Y513104** is strictly found in Northwest Caucasus (Adyghe) AND in **Komi/Tatars** (Ural/Volga). TMRCA is medieval.
**Hypothesis:** Migration via the Khazar Khaganate or Volga Bulgaria trade routes.

**Prompt for Deep Research:**
```text
TRACE THE "CAUCASUS-TO-URAL" MIGRATION VECTOR (700-1200 CE):
1.  **Archaeology:** Search for evidence of **Saltovo-Mayaki** (Alan/Khazar culture) outposts or trade factories north of the Volga-Kama confluence (Perm/Komi regions).
2.  **Genetics:** Look for "Caucasus autosomal admixture" (CHG/Alan ancestry) in modern **Komi** or **Volga Tatar** populations dating to the medieval period (ALDER/Rolloff decay dates).
3.  **Alan Diaspora:** Find records of Alan groups refugees fleeing the Arab-Khazar wars (737 CE) *north* up the Volga, instead of west to Don.
4.  **Target:** Physical evidence linking the Kuban-Black Sea region to the Kama River basin in the Khazar era.
```

## 🐎 Scenario 5: Steppe Introgression (R1a-Z93 in Northwest Caucasus)

**Context:**
R1a-Z93 is not native to West Caucasus but appears in specific princely clans (e.g., Tamby). TMRCA of local branches is ~1500 ybp (500 CE).

**Prompt for Deep Research:**
```text
DATING THE STEPPE ADMIXTURE IN CIRCASSIANS:
1.  **Rare Variant Dating:** Look for whole-genome sequencing studies dealing with "Adyghe" or "Circassian" populations that estimate the time of admixture with "Steppe_IA" (Iron Age) or "Turkic" sources.
2.  **Specific Lineage:** Search for the specific SNP **R-YP451** or **R-YP457** in ancient DNA databases (AADR, ENA). Are there any matches in:
    *   Saltovo-Mayaki sites?
    *   Golden Horde burials?
    *   Alanic timeline (North Ossetia)?
3.  **Historical Correlation:** Match TMRCA ~500 CE with:
    *   The Hunnic retreat?
    *   The Gokturk expansion (576 CE siege of Bosporus)?
    *   The Avar migration?

GOAL: Distinguish between "Alanic R1a" (Sarmatian legacy) and "Turkic R1a" (Kipchak/Khazar legacy) in the Adyghe gene pool.
